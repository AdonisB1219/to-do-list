# To-do-list
This project is made with node.js and express.js as back-end tools.

I also used figma (https://www.figma.com/file/6eNZ5lqbxJJzihn0dGNS9P/To-Do-List?type=design&node-id=1%3A2&mode=design&t=Hw71m4lAgBl2aies-1 "Figma link"), for design.

I used vanilla CSS, to accomplish a more personalized design.

This was an exciting project, where I also used EJS for templating, saving a lot of repetetive work.
